Mathematica graph tools for scattering amplitudes.

Definitely work in progress. Simple implementation based off of ideas presented eg in my TASI 2014 lecture notes: [arXiv:1506.00974](http://inspirehep.net/record/1374212) .

When released publically will likely have some sort of writeup / documentation / examples.
